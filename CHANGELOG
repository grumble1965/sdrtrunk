0.3.0-beta1 20170129
 - FEATURE: audio streaming - adds capability to stream to multiple remote broadcast
   servers (Broadcastify, Icecast v2.3 and v2.4+, and Shoutcast V1 and V2).  Each
   stream can be independently configured with a delay.  Audio calls are directed
   to one or more streams by attaching one or more stream identifiers to each alias.
 - Requires Java 8 (or newer) for compatibility and eventual changeover to JavaFX
 - Extensive GUI updates for tuner, channel and alias management.  Includes new
   'Now Playing' channel view and 'Detail' view.
 - Updated alias list management of alias id values and wildcards.  Weighting is now
   applied to each wildcard so that they can be ordered from most specific to least
   specific for lookup value matching purposes.
 - Added handling for Motorola-specific P25 patch messages and auto-generation of
   patch group aliases that roll-up aliases from each patched talkgroup to support
   audio recording and streaming of patch calls according to the identifiers and
   actions defined for each of the patched talkgroups.
 - Implemented bounded queues for both tuner and individual channel IQ sample
   buffers.  Bounded queues have ability to enter/exit overflow state when queue
   size reaches overflow threshold and reset when queue size falls below the reset
   threshold.
 - Updated airspy controller for airspy-mini specific sample rate handling.
 - New developer remez filter designer tool and internal usage
